All the other companies wanted to give me pennies on the dollar but Turbo Offers provided me the full value on the market. The experience was similar to selling through a realtor but this was you don’t have to put it on the market. I’m very happy. Thanks Turbo Offers.</p>

Their offer on my home was generous and it didn’t take long to take possession. I can’t express enough how grateful I am that I didn’t have to experience constant showings of my home. I was always updated by Monique and her team about every step. When I had questions, they were there. The process of selling my home was a breeze because of Turbo Offers!

It was refreshing to not deal with a traditional realtor sale and the headaches that usually came with it. Everything was simple.

I will definitely continue to use Turbo Offers.</p>

I will admit, there were times that tension ran a little high as this process involved a lot of unexpected highs and lows. But through it all, Turbo Offers stuck by me. They were in constant communication, providing me with realistic expectations and compassion. I don’t think this sale would have happened if I went with another company. I’m lucky that someone recommended Turbo Offers to me. I wish everyone involved in the process more success in the future!</p>

The home staging, haggling, months of waiting and dealing with a realtor who was at times demotivated- these were all reasons to not sell the traditional way ever again. With Turbo Offers, I sold my home in 3 weeks! I’m so glad we decided to use Turbo Offers. Yes they do take out more fees, but it was worth it! It saved us months of stress and they paid for our move. Such a great experience. </p>

The team that helped me were very polite and I felt like my best interest was always the center of it all. The process was simple and I think we got the better end of the stick after the sale. It was a pain-free, stress free transaction. It felt good since the sale of this house was contingent with the purchase of our new home. We were able to move to our new home 3 days after closing!

Everybody I encountered from the Homeowner Consultant to the Transaction Manager were so pleasant to work with and flexible with the closing date.

                    <p>When it was time for me to move to Atlanta to take care of my 85 year old mother, I contacted Turbo Offers. I am retired and have no credit history because I paid cash for everything. Working with Jared Whitmore, team leader of the trade homes department was amazing. He assured me that Turbo Offers would be able to help me and he was right! They traded mine and my mother’s homes and we bought one big home to accommodate both of us. It was easier than I ever imagined all because of Turbo Offers. Thank you!  </p>

                    <p>When I sold my home through Turbo Offers 9 months ago, it was such a great experience! At first I was skeptical but they were warm and very helpful with everything I needed. I initially got connected to Ryan. I was a bit reluctant in signing a contract without knowing the final price but he gave me an idea of how the result would be, explained every detail and I felt comfortable after that. Frankie was my contact guy after the inspection and he was quick to respond to my questions. Email after email, call after call. I had the option to choose a closing date, and the wire transfer was available within hours. The price I got for my house was more than fair and I didn’t go through the hassle of putting it on the market. I have already been recommending Turbo Offers to friends and will continue to do so.</p>

                    <p>IRichard Brown was the first person we spoke with when I got in touch with The Turbo Offers Team, his determination and professionalism made us turn down an offer from an open door that was $1500 more. He gave us the inspiration to move forward. Gigi took over once signed and has been with us every step of the way. There were so many moving parts when you are buying and selling a home at the same time, and she was always swift to respond, and was very patient with us during our tough times when we were frustrated and lost. So thankful for the way we were treated by many of the representatives from your company.

We were up against a due date and did not have ample enough time needed to complete the required updates to get the home sold for full market value. I contacted several wholesalers to get offers that could work with our schedule. Yes, The Turbo Offers Team was not the highest net to us, but their people were exceptional to work with and I appreciated the communication all throughout the process. Even though we did not get full market value, we feel like we got an honourable deal considering we did not end paying out of pocket for updates/repairs. Turbo Offers may not be for every seller, but I would certainly feel comfortable recommending it as an option to my sellers that may be in a similar situation as we were.     </p>

I felt like  I got a very honourable price and even a realtor in my neighborhood contacted me during the process and said that it was a good bargain. I was nervous because school was starting and I wasn't sure how long my home would be on the market. This is the way to go. Thanks Turbo Offers Team and good job!   </p>

Next came the home inspection, again Turbo Offers came through with an equitable amount. From the time we first contacted Turbo Offer till the time we closed was only three weeks. We are definitely glad we went with the Turbo Offers Team for the sale of our house.

Everybody I worked with were respectful and easy to talk to. They always responded to me in a timely fashion when I had questions. I would like to suggest though that they assign one person to be the main point of contact so you don’t get confused who you really deal with. And also make it clear to clients that First American Title is the one involved in the closing process. Otherwise this was a blissful experience for me.     </p>

                    <p>Yes, selling a home through Turbo Offers may not be ideal for everyone, but it was a perfect course of action for someone like me. I wasn’t prepared to deal with the customary home selling process (constant showings, back and forth negotiations, potential for buyer’s financing to fall through, etc.) With the Turbo Offers Team, it was swift and efficient from the very beginning. I was able to change my closing date multiple times while I worked on getting my new home, the free move that was included was a huge bonus and the 3 day extended stay program made it so I didn’t have to essentially move twice and live in a hotel waiting for my new home to be ready. Overall I am very satisified with the process from beginning to the end.

They’ve allowed me to show them pictures of my house and tell them about the upgrades and such. When I spoke with a rep, he was looking at pictures of my home, not just a piece of paper. And because of that, their offer solidified as better than the other two companies.

                    <p>Turbo Offers gave us an honourable offer. Along the way their workforce communicated punctually and we were able to close much faster than conventional loans, the people who wanted our property to buy and flip inadequate offers. I was hesitant at first but the Turbo Offers Team outperformed my expectations. With the other homes we will be selling in the future, I am most certain I’d use Turbo Offers again, thanks!.

They’re very welcoming and just, a sincere company to work with! They use a swift and efficient title company and I gained my home proceeds within 24 hours of the sale. I absolutely loved their partnership with Bellhops moving service, and the local move was made so much more painless!

The condition of the home wasn't great, and couldn't be sold through a customary listing process. Turbo Offers was very welcoming and cooperative to my client’s needs and schedules. Thanks again!

                    <p>The process of using Turbo Offers was simple and comprehensive. We were constructing a new home without a dependable completion date. The Turbo Offers Team provided us the freedom to extend our close date a number of times. This allotted us to close on both homes (Old home - sold to Turbo Offers and New Home - new construction) on the same day. All in all, this was a stellar experience.

                    <p>We were clueless with the process at the start but felt the time was right to sell & buy new home nearer specialists for our 10 year old daughter with complex medical needs. We didn't realize how insane it is selling a home at the same time you're buying a new one & how important timing becomes. The Turbo Offers Team granted us the hassle of having to list and wait for our home to sell and got the process started ASAP. At one point it looked like we weren't going to be far enough along in time when our girl was admitted for surgery with almost a week in the hospital. I contacted Calli a million questions about what this would mean and she called me right back on her own time to encourage and reassure us. She got in touch with Kinsley Porter, a Turbo Offers big boss & asked her to get in touch with us ASAP on a holiday. Kinsley called us first thing the next morning & got to know our circumstance and concerns. She immediately went right to work. Thanks to their kindhearted staff, everything was sped up so we could stay on track with house & surgery both. For us they aren't just a company they are angels.

We knew showing the home would painstakingly be a hassle and getting everyone to keep the house clean for the showings was a no-go. We might have been able to scrape out a couple thousand dollars more if we put the home up ourselves, but between the convenience of doing everything on our own time, and not having to stage the house, we most certainly saved ourselves a huge stress fest. Even the move was made easy by the Turbo Offers Team and the provided movers definitely was an icing to the cake.

My house was in need of a lot of repairs, It wasn’t practical for me to sell my house the traditional way. Since I work from home, it also wasn’t ideal to have people coming over to see the house. Turbo Offers made it possible for me to sell my house without getting any repairs done. They just deducted it from the final proceeds which was incredible. The closing was too easy! A mobile notary came to my house to sign the closing documents. Everything took 30 minutes. I will happily recommend Turbo Offers to everyone!

                    <p>As a single woman whose knowledge about renovations is little to none, Turbo Offer is the best option for me. I know absolutely nothing about remodel or minor updates to my home. Thankfully I didn’t have to do any of these. This decision was simple math really. Most realtors expect an average of 6% commission from the final selling price, plus the money I have to spend on updates to sell the home would be too much for me. That is why Turbo Offers was a blessing! They didn’t lowball me. They were actually above the tax appraisal’s estimate. The credits given to Turbo Offers to complete repairs were a bit higher than most but the personal time and effort I saved was well worth it. All I can say is DO THE MATH!!! Include a premium on your time and energy then decide. I have no regrets AND THEY'RE MOVING ME FOR FREE WITH A 3 DAY EXTENSION!! I tried other companies in the best and nobody can beat what Turbo Offers did for me.

                    <p>At first, the reason I chose Turbo Offers was to avoid frequent showings. I have 3 dogs at home. It just wasn’t a viable option. But after I accepted their offer, I stayed because of the people. Their customer service was superb. Everyone that helped me was genuine. I felt like they really did want me to get a good deal and it wasn’t hard to get a hold of someone when you have questions. They also offered FREE MOVE within 50 miles! Satisfied customer here!

                    <p>We are very pleased with Turbo Offers. My wife and I were impressed with how they handled the selling of our home from beginning to end. Somebody was always available to answer our questions or refer us to who could help us. We are happy with our decision and we will certainly recommend Turbo Offers to those considering selling their home.

                    <p>They were fair and reasonable. This was validated by 2 independent realtors that I met prior to contacting them. A friend of mine used them and encouraged me as well. I liked their option to electronically transfer funds to my account after both parties have signed. My first contact was Maria Johnson and she gave me a full disclosure of all the information I needed. My final contact was Kaye Zorn who was the ultimate “expediter and closer.” She made my requested close date possible! She was the perfect person for the job! In between was Tiffany O’neil whom I got awesome tips from. She advised me about the “portability” of moving my homestead exemptions from the house I sold to the one I’m living in. It was an awesome experience! Will use them again!

Everything else was outstanding. The staff worked hard together to make sure we closed on time. I was surprised with the offer I got! If I ever need to sell another house, no doubt I would use Turbo Offers.

I had 2 fall out’s and a couple of unpleasant realtors, one had to be released, one got upset because I didn’t want to sell lower for a certain buyer. All these were reasons to go another way which made us contact Turbo Offers. My wife submitted a quote and after 35 days we were closing! Thank God, our savior and Father in heaven for helping us all throughout our ordeal. Turbo Offers simplified a process that used to be so stressful.
