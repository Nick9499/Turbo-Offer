             <div class="panel">
                 <p>Yes. Even though you don’t need an agent to sell your home to Turbo Offers, if you’re already working with an agent or your home is currently listed, we will work with your agent directly. Simply have your agent submit your request for an offer on your behalf or submit your home with your agent’s information and we’ll take it from there.</p>

             <div class="panel">
                 <p>Yes. Because few homeowners have the financial capability to own two homes at the same time, Turbo Offers helps you time the purchase of your new home with the sale of your existing home to us. The transactions happen back-to-back and reduce the stress that you might otherwise experience. You can speak with one of our Solutions Advisors to learn more.</p>

                 <p>Improvements (or renovations) to your home are an important factor in how we determine the value of your home and our purchase offer, so it is important you tell us about them in your offer request. Photos of your improvements also help; you can upload them when making an offer request or send them via email to info@myturbooffer.com; please make sure that you include your home’s address in your email.</p>

                 <p>Turbo Offers typically provides you with an offer within 24-hours after you submit your request. However, if you don’t initially submit photos, we’ll wait 24-hours to finish our offer and give you more time to send us photos. If you are unable to upload or send photos, simply send us an email at info@myturbooffer.com and we will move forward without them.</p>

                 <p>Yes! Our offers are not computer generated or based solely upon our powerful algorithm. Our team of real estate experts evaluates every property carefully and photos help them to have a more accurate understanding of your home’s condition, features and overall value.</p>

                 <p>We understand. Simply email our Customer Success Team and we’ll move forward without photos. Remember, though, that the tenants have to move out by closing or end of Stay Longer, or we can’t buy your home.</p>

             <div class="panel">
                 <p>Yes, photos are usually optional. However, there are some cases where photos are required. Reasons we might require photos can include age of home, lack of comparable properties, or because we don’t feel that we can get a true idea of the value of your home without photos. If we determine that photos are required, you’ll receive an email from our team.</p>

                 <p>Yes. Home values will often change based upon market activity, competition and other factors. Our offers will usually expire in four days from the date of the offer. However, Turbo Offers is happy to provide you with an updated offer, just click on the Renew button at the top of your expired offer. Please be aware that our renewed offer price may be unchanged, higher or lower than your original offer depending upon current market conditions. In rare instances, we may conclude that we are unable to renew an offer.</p>

             <div class="panel">
                 <p>Depending upon the condition, we will typically perform light renovations on the home to get it market-ready. These items may include upgrading appliances, painting, putting in new carpet or maybe even upgrading countertops. We’ll install for sale signs, hold open houses, send out flyers, take care of listing paperwork, talk to agents, wait for and negotiate with a buyer, work with the appraiser, worry about buyer financing falling through, pay holding costs, utilities and association dues. In short, once we’ve bought your house, we take on the costs, risks, hassles, and headaches associated with selling a home.</p>
